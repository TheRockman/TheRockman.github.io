          Marley was dead: to begin with. There is no doubt whatever about that. The register of his burial was signed by the
          clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge’s name was good upon
          ’Change, for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mind! I don’t mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I
          might have been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade. But the
          wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the Country’s done for.
          You will therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were partners for I don’t
          know how many years. Scrooge was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole assign, his sole residuary
          legatee, his sole friend, and sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event, but that
          he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral, and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mention of Marley’s funeral brings me back to the point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley was dead.
          This must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate. If we were not
          perfectly convinced that Hamlet’s Father died before the play began, there would be nothing more remarkable in his
          taking a stroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts, than there would be in any other middle-aged
          gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spot—say Saint Paul’s Churchyard for instance—literally to
          astonish his son’s weak mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scrooge never painted out Old Marley’s name. There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge
          and Marley. The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge,
          and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. It was all the same to him.
